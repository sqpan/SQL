Window function:
a window function performs a calculation across 
a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row

OVER and PARTITION BY. These are key to window functions. Not every window function uses PARTITION BY;
we can also use ORDER BY or no statement at all depending on the query we want to run

/*
You can use window functions to identify what percentile 
(or quartile, or any other subdivision)
a given row falls into. The syntax is NTILE(*# of buckets*)

In other words, when you use a NTILE function but the number of rows in the partition is 
less than the NTILE(number of groups), 
then NTILE will divide the rows into as many groups as there are members (rows) 
in the set but then stop short of the requested number of groups. 
If youâ€™re working with very small windows,
 keep this in mind and consider using quartiles or similarly small bands.
