/*
SQL's two strict rules for appending data:

Both tables must have the same number of columns.
Those columns must have the same data types in the same order as the first table.
A common misconception is that column names have to be the same. 
Column names, in fact, don't need to be the same to append two tables but you will find that they typically are.

UNION will only return the distinct data, UNION ALL will return all of data

/*
One way to make a query run faster is to reduce the number of calculations that need to be performed. 
Some of the high-level things that will affect the number of calculations a given query will make include:

Table size
Joins
Aggregations
Query runtime is also dependent on some things that you canâ€™t really control related to the database itself:

Other users running queries concurrently on the database
Database software and optimization (e.g. Postgres is optimized differently than Redshift)
*/


/*
Aggregations is executed before limit, so it won't help to fast the query
In this case, sub query will help to speed up

# Add EXPLAIN before query can show the run time. 
# Try to change query and run it again to see if there is improve
